stereo_calibration
==================

Calibrate and compute the disparity map of stereo camera input.
To calibrate, you must indicate a set of pictures in the file
list. These pictures will be used to calibrate the cameras by the
program testcv.prog. You can set a new list of pictures to analyse
in the file list_test, and analyse them with the program remap.prog.
